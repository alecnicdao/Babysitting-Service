<h2>Caregivers</h2>
<p>
    Everyone is a caregiver whether they know it or not. For example, dropping by your mom's house to clean the house and maybe help her with
    laundry or other things she needs done around the house. Another example is mowing the lawn for your dad while he is at work, and then finding
    yourself taking care of the weeds and watering the grass afterwords. Gradually, you are doing more and more. At some point, you realize you 
    have made a commitment to take care of someone else.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes, caregiving is triggered by a major health event, such as a stroke, heart attack, or accident. Maybe you suddenly realize that 
    dad’s memory lapses have become dangerous. Life as you know it stops, and all your energy goes to caring for that person. Caregiving 
    has become your new career, and you adjust to a new normal. For example, there was this story about Alec. He got diagnosed with Ulcerative 
    Colitis at the age of 15 then when he was 18 he got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Alec's sister Kamarie never pictured herself being 
    a caregiver in her life, but as Alec was dealing with these illnesses she would care for him with whatever he needed whether that was food, 
    medications, or just someone to talk to while dealing with his illnesses. 
</p>

<h3>The Caregiver Role</h3>
<p>
    Caregivers can be spouses, partners, adult children, parents, other relatives (siblings, aunts, nieces/nephews, in-laws, grandchildren), 
    friends, neighbors. Whatever your relationship with the person you’re caring for, it’s important that you add the title caregiver to the 
    list of things you are. Without identifying yourself as a caregiver, you won’t know to search for resources that can help you navigate 
    this new role.
</p>

<p>
    But caregivers play other roles as well. You may be employed full or part-time. You may be raising children, or be a volunteer, a spouse, 
    have other family commitments. Adding caregiving to that list can easily lead to frustration and exhaustion. You might need to navigate 
    social service systems, call doctors while you’re at work, advocate for the care receiver, and take care of their day-to-day needs, while 
    you try to do all of those same things for yourself and your family.
</p>
        
<p>
    You are rarely trained to do the broad range of tasks you are asked to do as a caregiver. As a result, you may end up, for example, with 
    back strain because you haven’t had the benefit of training from a physical therapist on how to correctly transfer someone from bed to 
    chair, or wheelchair to car. Or you find yourself battling with your mother who has a certain type of Cancer because you have not learned 
    the skills necessary to communicate with someone with that type of sickness. 
</p>

<h3>Tasks Caregivers do</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Buy groceries, cook, clean house, do laundry, provide transportation
    </li>
    <li>
        Help the care receiver get dressed, take a shower, take medicine
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer someone out of bed/chair, help with physical therapy, perform medical interventions—injections, feeding tubes, 
        wound treatment, breathing treatments
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrange medical appointments, drive to the doctor, sit in during appointments, monitor medications
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk with doctors, nurses, care managers, and others to understand what needs to be done
    </li>
    <li>
        Be in there presence. In other words, giving someone attention if they just need someone to talk to
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here at Alec's Babysitting Registry we help provide you with the best care possible. Whether that's your children, parents, pets, and even
    your home if you need.
