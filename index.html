<h2>Babysitting</h2>
<p>
    Once upon a time, finding a babysitter wasn’t all that difficult. In fact, grandma and grandpa was typically the go-to candidate. 
    All it took was a quick phone call or quickly showing up at their door with the kids. Eventually, parents, and even single parents 
    become a little more widely distributed, and many began needing searching beyond the blood-bound parameters to find a trustworthy 
    soul on whom to depend on. In truth, this wasn’t really much of an issue back in the day. Most neighborhoods had their fair shares of 
    responsible teenagers ready and willing to come to the community’s assistance. This created a mutual opportunity for everyone involved. 
    Parents with young children could work an extra few hours every day or schedule a date night without fear, and those young teens were 
    able to earn a little extra spending money while developing a reputation for being dependable and mature enough to handle the job. 
    Obviously, times have changed. These days, grandma either lives across the country or has a social life of her own. Those levelheaded 
    teens are still out there, but they’re fewer and farther between than only a few short decades ago. The remaining few who aren’t too 
    overloaded with homework to take on part-time babysitting gigs have been sought out by a lucky handful of families and placed on retainer. 
    What are the rest of us to do?

<h3>Solution and information</h3>
<p>
    We understand the struggle, and we developed our website to help fill the growing gap in supply versus demand. 
    We realize in this generation it is very hard to find someone to watch your kids. So first and foremost, we're your all-inclusive link to a 
    number of different cargiver connection websites. For example, care.com and sittercity.com. Aside from that we give you more information on
    if you are a parent wanting to be a babysitting, a caregiver wanting to care for kids, job opportunities in the babysitting industry, and types
    of care we can help you find. 
</p>

<h3>Availabilty</h3>
<p>
    When you’re looking for a babysitter, you need someone whose availability matches your schedule. Without the capacity to be there when you 
    need them, all the other characteristics you’re hoping for are moot points. On Alec's Babysitting Registry, we'll help find the type of 
    caregiver you are looking for whether that is part-time or full-time. With that when you look for a babysitter you always would like them
    to be available sometimes when you call them. For example, if you are concerned about things or just miss your baby/babies and just want to 
    check up on things they will be available or in some way get back to you in a matter of time. So here at Alec's Babysitting Registry we help
    provide you with the best babysitter that is right for you.

<h3>Traits to consider when looking for a babysitter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Enthusiasm: The babysitter should genuinely enjoy caring for children and approach their work with an energy that shows they’re truly 
    interested in the kids in their care.
    </li>

    <li>Initiative: The babysitter may not know the ins and outs of your household right away, but they should be able to jump right in, get 
    the children engaged and anticipate their needs right away with a positive attitude.
    </li>

    <li>Playfulness: The sitter should possess the ability to play and knows how to keep kids entertained as much as possible. 
    For example, a sitter should schedule some time to go play at the park, have a fun science experient, and just help the kids
    learn as much as possible while having fun doing it. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Responsibility: No matter how much fun they’re having, your sitter should always get the kids in bed on time and stick to the parents 
    routine given to the babysitter. Ultimately, parents need to know their children are in good hands, so the ability to stick to rules and 
    routines is very important.
    </li>
    
    <li>Professionalism: Babysitting, even in more casual scenarios, is a real job and should be taken seriously. The sitter should be reliable, 
    dedicated and have experience. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Accountability: The babysitter should show up on time, honor commitments and value the responsibility they have to your family. 
    </li>
</ul>
