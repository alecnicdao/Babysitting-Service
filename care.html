<h2>The Care We Need</h2>
<p>
    Are you in need of help around the home? Trying to juggle work, family and other responsibilities leaves many with little time for themselves,
    and this fails to take into account that certain areas of life may suffer when a person takes on too much. We understand this and are here to 
    ensure your problems are over. Whether you are in need of a babysitter to have a night out with your spouse or you need a full time nanny to 
    care for the children, we help you find the individual who best meets your needs. For many, however, more assistance is needed in and around 
    the home. For this reason, we also help those in need of a tutor for their child, a pet sitter, a house cleaner or elderly care. Find the right
    person based on your specific requirements, whether this be their rating, pay rate credentials or another variable. We are here to help.
</p>

<h3>Babysitter</h3>
<img src="resources/babysitter.jpg" alt="sleepy baby" width="200px" height=auto class="flLeft">
<p>Most families are reluctant to trust their children to someone who has little-to-no experience working with youngsters, and rightly so. 
    Of course, a babysitting history directly related to your children’s age groups is equally vital. Our sitters’ familiarity with various 
    age groups are clearly listed on their profiles, so you can choose based on their previous experience. They’re also ready and willing to 
    provide references at your request, giving you the added peace of mind that comes with knowing other parents have been satisfied with their 
    services.</p>

<h3>Nanny</h3>
<img src="resources/nanny.jpeg" alt="nanny carrying baby" width="200px" height=auto class="flRight">
<p>Nannies aren’t simply a childcare provider. They actually co-parent the child along with the mother and father, thus this can become a very 
    complex relationship. Mothers especially often find they begin resenting the provider, feeling this person is taking on their role. This 
    doesn’t have to be the case, however, if certain steps are taken. For example, parents need to clearly lay out what is and isn’t expected 
    of the nanny and should establish boundaries right away. By doing so, there is no confusion. It’s all a matter of what the nanny and parents 
    are comfortable with and have agreed upon up front, and this needs to be addressed in the initial interviews. To learn more about this 
    relationship and how to get on the right track from day one, be sure to read Creating the Best Relationship with Your Nanny.</p>

<h3>Day Care</h3>
<img src="resources/daycare.jpeg" alt="child coloring" width="200px" height=auto class="flLeft">
<p>Daycare, as its name so obviously suggests, is a childcare option that allows parents to drop off their children during the day for care, 
    supervision, and learning. ... Many daycare centers are national or regional chains, and some are privately owned. Daycares may also be 
    in-home, run by a single person. Parents spend an average of $211 per week for daycare in a daycare center and $200 for care in a home. 
    What is the average cost of daycare per day? On average, parents spend $40 per day on childcare in a full-time setting. </p>

<h3>Pet Sitter</h3>
<img src="resources/petsitter.jpeg" alt="puppy in a cup" width="200px" height=auto class="flRight">
<p>Like other professional services, referrals are an excellent place to start the search for a pet sitter. Friends, family, and neighbors can 
    be a great source of recommendations, as can veterinary offices. Finally, owners can look online for help. Babysitter’s Registry has a pet 
    sitter location service that puts pet owners in touch with professional sitters in their area. When the owner inputs their ZIP code, they 
    can filter results by experience and services offered, among other criteria.</p>

<h3>Senior Care</h3>
<img src="resources/seniorcare.jpeg" alt="nurse giving aid to elderly couple" width="200px" height=auto class="flLeft">
<p>The process of finding a senior caregiver starts when the family makes an objective, honest list of the support and services the senior needs, 
    both now and in the future. Maintaining a measure of independence, getting assistance with hygiene and dressing, managing the administration 
    of medicines, and keeping people safe are all important tasks, and knowing a senior’s needs ahead of time can help families define their 
    budgets and their options.
</p>

<h3>House Cleaning</h3>
<img src="resources/housecleaning.jpeg" alt="broom sweeping" width="200px" height=auto class="flRight">
<p>Keeping the house clean can be quite a chore, even when someone lives alone. When roommates, children, spouses, and pets are added to the 
    equation, the task can seem like it never ends. That’s why many people turn to housekeepers to get the job done. While housecleaning help 
    isn’t free, most customers find the extra time bought by hiring outside help to be worth the investment. Like other services, though, there 
    are points to consider and questions to ask before bringing strangers into the home. Housekeepers are in a trusted position, just like a 
    contractor, babysitter, or senior caregiver. While hiring help can bring a much-needed feeling of relief, it only happens if families do their 
    esearch. In this guide, customers can learn what they need to know before looking for a housekeeper online.
</p>

<h3>Tutor</h3>
<img src="resources/tutor.jpeg" alt="child doing homework" width="200px" height=auto class="flLeft">
<p>With the increasingly competitive drive to get into private schools and colleges, children of varying ages and education levels can benefit 
    from tutoring. While online tutoring is often a cost-effective and convenient option, private tutors are a better fit for some students. 
    However, finding the right tutor can seem like an impossible task. To make it easier for parents, we’ve broken the process down into manageable
    teps that can keep kids on the right educational track.
