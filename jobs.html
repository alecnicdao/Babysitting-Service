<h2>Job Opportunities</h2>
<p>
    Once you're ready to start working with children, it's time to decide how you want to work with them. Do you want to be able to watch them
    at your house only or at their house only? Do you want this to be your full-time or part-time job? These are just a few questions to ask yourself
    because it will help you pick the child care career path that best suites you.
</p>

<p>
    Alec's Babysitting Registry helps you find the best job that suites you. Whether that is a babysitter, nanny, day care worker, pet sitter,
    senior care sitter, house cleaning assistant, or even a tutor.
</p>

<h3>1. Babysitter</h3>
<p>
    Babysitters generally watch one or more children for an hourly (rather than salaried or weekly) rate. If they do anything extra, they usually 
    receive more pay. A babysitter can either have a regular schedule, such as every Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., or help out only when needed
     (e.g. date nights, appointments, etc.).
</p>

<p>
    Babysitters can make a higher hourly rate if they have more experience, but aren't usually long-term child care providers. Most babysitters 
    work for more than one family at a time to fill their schedules, as well.
</p>

<h3>2. Nannies</h3>
<p>
    A nanny typically cares for the children in one family on a full-time or part-time basis. The nanny can either live at home with the family, 
    or live outside of the home. If she lives with the family, a nanny usually receives a salary, in addition to room and board. If she's a 
    live-out nanny, she receives a higher salary to compensate for the lack of room and board.
</p>

<p>
    In general, nannies provide more consistent care, are more involved with the development and education of the children, and are highly 
    trusted household employees. Many families typically are willing to pay more for a nanny who's experienced, or who has a degree in childhood
     development or education. 
</p>

<h3>3. Day Care Workers</h3>
<p>
    Day care workers find jobs in child care centers or family home day cares, where they care for several children at a time. They usually 
    monitor play time, teach social skills, and provide pre-kindergarten lessons and activities for the children. If they're caring for babies 
    and toddlers, day care workers are also responsible for feeding them and changing their diapers.
</p>

<p>
    Day care workers often work more traditional “office hours,” as most day cares are only open during the week. Additionally, they may get more 
    benefits if hired through a facility, such as health care or paid time off. Keep in mind that some day cares do require workers to have a few 
    years’ experience and/or official training or education in childhood development.
</p>

<h3>4. Pet Sitter</h3>
<ul>
    A pet sitter does much more than provide pets with water and food while their owners are away. Reliable pet sitters spend quality time with 
    animals, give them exercise, and determine when they need specialized attention. In many cases, pet sitters offer extra services, such as 
    watering plants and checking the mail. However, just because someone refers to themselves as a pet sitter, that doesn’t mean they are qualified
    for the job. Professional pet sitters offer benefits such as:

    <li>
        Keeping pets in a well-known environment
    </li>

    <li>
        Keeping them on a regular routine and diet
    </li>

    <li>
        Paying close attention while owners are away
    </li>

    <li>
        Letting the pet be the priority
    </li>

    <li>
        Avoidance of crowded boarding kennels
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Senior Care</h3>
<p>
    More than 41 million people in America have chronic health conditions that limit their ability to perform activities necessary for daily 
    living, according to information from the University of California’s Institute for Health & Aging. Of that number, almost 12 million cannot 
    live independently. One in five elderly people are 85 or older, and half of these citizens are impaired enough to need long-term care; that 
    is, personal help that allows them to do routine tasks such as dressing, eating, and bathing.
</p>

<p>
    While most people want to remain in their homes as long as they possibly can, it’s not always possible in the absence of outside help. 
    Many elders who need help with daily activities rely on care provided by friends and family members, but families and seniors are increasingly 
    recognizing the advantages of hiring in-home caregivers. These professionals allow seniors to stay in the safety, comfort, and familiarity of 
    home, and they provide families priceless peace of mind. In many cases, state and federal government agencies have set aside funds to allow 
    people who couldn’t otherwise afford it to get outside help. In this guide, families can get ten tips on finding senior care online.
</p>

<h3>6. House Cleaning</h3>
<p>
    Keeping the house clean can be quite a chore, even when someone lives alone. When roommates, children, spouses, and pets are added to the 
    equation, the task can seem like it never ends. That’s why many people turn to housekeepers to get the job done. While housecleaning help 
    isn’t free, most customers find the extra time bought by hiring outside help to be worth the investment. Like other services, though, there 
    are points to consider and questions to ask before bringing strangers into the home. Housekeepers are in a trusted position, just like a 
    contractor, babysitter, or senior caregiver. While hiring help can bring a much-needed feeling of relief, it only happens if families do 
    their research. In this guide, customers can learn what they need to know before looking for a housekeeper online.
</p>

<h3>7. Tutor</h3>
<p>
    With the increasingly competitive drive to get into private schools and colleges, children of varying ages and education levels can benefit 
    from tutoring. While online tutoring is often a cost-effective and convenient option, private tutors are a better fit for some students. 
    However, finding the right tutor can seem like an impossible task. To make it easier for parents, we’ve broken the process down into manageable
    steps that can keep kids on the right educational track.
